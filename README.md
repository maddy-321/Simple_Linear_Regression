# Simple_Linear_Regression
Simple linear regression provides a means to model a straight line relationship between two variables. In classical (or asymmetric ) regression one variable (Y) is called the response or dependent variable, and the other (X) is called the explanatory or independent variable. This is in contrast to correlation where there is no distinction between Y and X in terms of which is an explanatory variable and which a response variable.
